# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulator

A complete end-to-end deep learning project that trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to autonomously drive a car in a simulator using behavioral cloning.  
Inspired by NVIDIA’s groundbreaking research _End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars_ (Bojarski et al., 2016).

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an autonomous driving system using deep learning techniques. The system:

- Collects driving data from a simulator
- Trains a CNN model using behavioral cloning
- Deploys the trained model to control a virtual car in real-time
- Uses computer vision and neural networks to predict steering angles

The approach follows the **end-to-end learning paradigm** demonstrated by NVIDIA, where raw pixels are directly mapped to steering commands, eliminating the need for separate lane detection, path planning, or rule-based control.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

This project adapts the **NVIDIA CNN architecture** introduced in *End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars*. The model directly maps raw camera images to steering commands using an end-to-end learning approach.

### NVIDIA-Inspired CNN

* **Input:** 66×200×3 YUV images (cropped, normalized, resized)
* **Convolutions:** 5 layers for feature extraction
* **Fully Connected:** 3 layers for control decision
* **Output:** Single steering angle value (regression)

```python
# Convolutional Layers
Conv2D(24, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation='elu')
Conv2D(36, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation='elu')
Conv2D(48, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation='elu')
Conv2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation='elu')
Conv2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation='elu')

# Fully Connected Layers
Flatten()
Dense(100, activation='elu')
Dense(50, activation='elu')
Dense(10, activation='elu')
Dense(1, activation='linear')   # Steering angle output
```

📌 **Key Insight:**
The network automatically learns road features (lane boundaries, curves, etc.) directly from steering data, without explicit labels, making it robust to varied driving conditions.

## 🔄 Data Processing

### Image Preprocessing

1. Crop: remove sky/hood (60:135)
2. Convert RGB → YUV
3. Gaussian Blur (3×3 kernel)
4. Resize to 200×66 pixels
5. Normalize pixel values to \[0,1]

### Data Augmentation

* Random panning
* Zooming (1.0–1.2x)
* Brightness variation (0.4–1.2x)
* Horizontal flipping with steering inversion

### Data Balancing

* Analyze steering angle distribution
* Reduce bias from straight-driving data
